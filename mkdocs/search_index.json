This is a required field for authentication.\n\n\nHTTP Loopback Workaround\n\n\nThis is a workaround for web hosts that have HTTP loopback prevention. Do not enable this unless your orders are not exporting and you have confirmed that loopback prevention is enabled on your server.\n\n\nToken\n\n\nThis will be the token the system cron job uses. This is to prevent unauthorised running of the Xero Integration extension. Alphanumeric can be used. The box below will be the cron job command to use for your cron job. Best recommended to run Xero Integration cron command hourly.\n\n\nSales Account Code\n\n\nUsually this is 200. Please check your Chart of Accounts to confirm. This is the sales account code.

Please check your Chart of Accounts to confirm. This is the shipping / freight account code. If you have more accounts in your Xero account for your multi store setup, you can assign each multi store a different account code.\n\n\nPayment Account Code\n\n\nPlease check your Chart of Accounts to confirm the account code. This is the bank / payment account code. If you have more accounts in your Xero account for your multi store setup, you can assign each multi store a different account code.\n\n\nRounding Account Code\n\n\nUsually this is 860. Please check your Chart of Accounts to confirm. This is the rounding account code for tax differences.

It can only be authorised or draft.\n\n\nOrder Statuses to Export\n\n\nThis will be the order status the orders are required to reach before they are sent over to Xero. This will be good to reduce pending payments on your Xero account.\n\n\nOrder Statuses to Remove\n\n\nThis will be the order status the orders are required to reach before they are removed from Xero. Do note that AUTHORISED invoices will be voided, and DRAFT invoices will be deleted. If orders are already marked to other statuses on Xero, Xero does not allow us to update it.\n\n\nSync Products to Xero Inventory\n\n\nXero has their own inventory. If you wish to sync your products quantities with Xero, you can turn on this function. We will then attempt to sync the stock quantities from Xero and update your product quantities on OpenCart. Model code is used for keeping Xero inventory and OpenCart products in sync.\n\n\nMark All Orders\n\n\nMark all orders as exported and our system will ignore all the orders previously made in your store. This is useful for larger stores that just installed our Xero Integration but does not wish to export old orders.\n\n\nUnmark All Orders\n\n\nMark all orders as not exported and our system will attempt to export all unmarked orders again.\n\n\nDebug\n\n\nEnable this to write debugging logs to your OpenCart error logs. This is useful to determine the issue if your orders are not being exported.\n\n\nDebug Order\n\n\nThis is useful to debug specific order ID that's having issues being exported.

Getting your Key   Secret  Generate a new certificate (see point 5 below) or use the certificate included in the zip package of our software. Proceed to https://app.xero.com/Application/ to setup your application.   Add an application.  Select \"Private Application\".  Enter an Application Name (e.g. OpenCart Integration).  Select an organisation for application to access.  Upload the certificate file (file is located in our zip folder ( system/library/xero/certs/xero_public.cer ).  Agree to Xero's terms and conditions.  Save the application.  You will now be presented with the consumer key and consumer secret.      Setup Cron Job  Setup a cron job task to automate the export. The cron job command is provided in your admin dashboard. Please copy it and setup your cron job task accordingly in your cPanel.    Xero Integration Configurations  API Consumer Key  The API Consumer Key is available from your Xero application. This is a required field for authentication.  API Secret Key  The API Secret Key is available from your Xero application. This is a required field for authentication.  HTTP Loopback Workaround  This is a workaround for web hosts that have HTTP loopback prevention. Do not enable this unless your orders are not exporting and you have confirmed that loopback prevention is enabled on your server.  Token  This will be the token the system cron job uses. This is to prevent unauthorised running of the Xero Integration extension. Alphanumeric can be used. The box below will be the cron job command to use for your cron job. Best recommended to run Xero Integration cron command hourly.  Sales Account Code  Usually this is 200. Please check your Chart of Accounts to confirm. This is the sales account code. If you have more accounts in your Xero account for your multi store setup, you can assign each multi store a different account code. You can find all the account codes you require in your Chart of Accounts as per screenshot below.   Shipping Account Code  Usually this is 425. Please check your Chart of Accounts to confirm. This is the shipping / freight account code. If you have more accounts in your Xero account for your multi store setup, you can assign each multi store a different account code.  Payment Account Code  Please check your Chart of Accounts to confirm the account code. This is the bank / payment account code. If you have more accounts in your Xero account for your multi store setup, you can assign each multi store a different account code.  Rounding Account Code  Usually this is 860. Please check your Chart of Accounts to confirm. This is the rounding account code for tax differences. If you have more accounts in your Xero account for your multi store setup, you can assign each multi store a different account code. A new rounding line will appear, if required, as per screenshot below.   Inventory Account Code  Usually this is 630. Please check your Chart of Accounts to confirm. This is the inventory account code for tracked inventory.  Cost of Goods Sold Account Code  Usually this is 310. Please check your Chart of Accounts to confirm. This is the Cost of Goods Sold account code.  Default Invoice Status  The default status of the invoice when it is sent over to Xero. It can only be authorised or draft.  Order Statuses to Export  This will be the order status the orders are required to reach before they are sent over to Xero. This will be good to reduce pending payments on your Xero account.  Order Statuses to Remove  This will be the order status the orders are required to reach before they are removed from Xero. Do note that AUTHORISED invoices will be voided, and DRAFT invoices will be deleted. If orders are already marked to other statuses on Xero, Xero does not allow us to update it.  Sync Products to Xero Inventory  Xero has their own inventory. If you wish to sync your products quantities with Xero, you can turn on this function. We will then attempt to sync the stock quantities from Xero and update your product quantities on OpenCart. Model code is used for keeping Xero inventory and OpenCart products in sync.  Mark All Orders  Mark all orders as exported and our system will ignore all the orders previously made in your store. This is useful for larger stores that just installed our Xero Integration but does not wish to export old orders.  Unmark All Orders  Mark all orders as not exported and our system will attempt to export all unmarked orders again.  Debug  Enable this to write debugging logs to your OpenCart error logs. This is useful to determine the issue if your orders are not being exported.  Debug Order  This is useful to debug specific order ID that's having issues being exported. Debug needs to be enabled before this feature will work.    Generating Your Certificate (optional)  If you wish to generate your own certificate, please follow the instructions below.
