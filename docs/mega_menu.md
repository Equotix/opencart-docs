## Description

Mega Menu is an improvement of the Category Module in OpenCart. It allows you to have a drop down menu instead of the default listing for the sub-categories. As you move between the categories, it refines your searches and narrows it down. Mega Menu supports up to 4 layers. I.e. Category > Children Category > Grandchildren Category > Great Grandchildren Category. Mega Menu also allows you to easily modify the CCS styling to match your custom theme.
